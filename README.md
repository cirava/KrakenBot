This is created as a personal project to create a WPILib C++ frame for a robot that uses (nearly) entirely Kraken X60 motors.
As my FRC team plans to use them next year, I wanted to make sure we had an idea of where to start.
This can be used as a free resource for any FRC team, as I understand how hard it can be to find C++ example code, this is why I made this in the first place.
Have fun, and I must add that I don't have a robot to test any of this code on, but use as an example if you must.
